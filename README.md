# Memory management

This project consist in designing a memory allocator and constructing diagnostic tools. The custom allocator project will have two parts. 
# Memory allocater
This part consists in implementing a working custom memory allocator for C++ supporting: new, delete, new[], delete[], malloc, free.
# Diagnostic tools
This part consists in implementing diagnostic tools (such as logs, diagnostics, benchmarks) to help debug/profile the allocator performance
in terms of the fragmentation state of the memory pool and speed when it comes to allocating/deallocating memory.
